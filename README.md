# Exploring Causal Inference

I’ve been diving into **causal inference** lately, trying to wrap my head around concepts like **treatment effects, backdoor criteria, and placebo tests**. Nothing groundbreaking—just me learning, experimenting, and making sense of things.  

The dataset I have used is [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

To keep track of what I’ve explored, I’ve put everything into a **Jupyter Notebook**, which I’ve uploaded to this GitHub repo. It includes:  

- **Propensity scores & binary treatments** (like BMI > 25 and its effect on diabetes)  
- **Graphical Causality Models (GCMs)** to understand causality  
- **Refutation tests** (because, let’s be honest, it’s easy to fool yourself with data)  
- Some **visualizations** to make the results clearer  

This is more of a learning log than a polished project and it might even be incorrect, but if you're also trying to get into causal inference, feel free to check it out!
